# Styling

The component is basically styled with Sass (scss). All relevant variables and colors can be overwriten in your project.

There are several variables with default values and predefined colors which can be changed:
- [Colors](https://github.com/ckotzbauer/simple-tree-component/tree/main/dist/scss/colors.scss)
- [Default variables](https://github.com/ckotzbauer/simple-tree-component/tree/main/dist/scss/defaults.scss)

The root css-class is `.simple-tree` which wraps the whole component. The tree itself has the `.simple-tree-node-container` as root-class.
The dropdown-container DOM-Nodes are located outside of the component-structure (directly under the body-element).
The css-class used there is `.simple-tree-dropdown-holder`.

See [here](https://github.com/ckotzbauer/simple-tree-component/tree/main/dist/scss) for more info.
If you have questions to specific variables or classes, feel free to reach out on Github. :)
